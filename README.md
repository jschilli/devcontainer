# devcontainer

borrowed heavily from [vscode-dev-rust](https://github.com/eggyal/vscode-dev-rust/tree/main) for structure

A [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) that can be used for [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview).

This container builds upon [VS Code's official Rust development container](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/rust) by addingâ€”

* Various useful/popular [Cargo subcommands](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-05-extending-cargo.html):
  * [cargo-edit](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-edit): addition, removal and upgrading of dependencies from the command line;
  * [cargo-expand](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-expand): shows the result of macro and `#[derive]` expansion;
  * [cargo-hack](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-hack): various options useful for testing; and
  * [cargo-tree](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-tree): visualizes a crate's dependency graph in a tree-like format.
  * [cargo-component](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-component): wasm component builder.

* The [just command runner](https://crates.io/crates/just).

The principle motivations for defining this container separately from individual projects are to promote reuse, achieve stable/reproducible environments and maximize dev-parity with CI environments.

See also [Jon Gjengset](https://github.com/jonhoo/rust-ci-conf)'s ci config for inspiration to maintain this independent of a project

## applying to an existing project

This folder can be or was merged using a --allow-unrelated-histories merge
strategy from <https://github.com/jonhoo/rust-ci-conf/> which provides a
reasonably sensible base for writing your own ci on. By using this strategy
the history of the CI repo is included in your repo, and future updates to
the CI can be merged later.

To perform this merge run:

```shell
git remote add ci https://github.com/jschilli/devcontainer.git
git fetch ci
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories ci/main
```


## Example usage

Set your project's `devcontainer.json` as follows (updating `my-project` as appropriate):

```javascript
{
  "name": "my-project-dev",
  "image": "eggyal/vscode-dev-rust:1-bullseye", // append @sha256:[digest] to pin to a specific version

  // Cargo settings to speed up compilation in development environments.
  //
  // By configuring these settings via envvars rather than Cargo configuration
  // files, the same image can be used to provide a parity toolchain in CI/CD
  // environments that use less development-oriented settings.
  "containerEnv": {
    "CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG": "1",
    "CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_INCREMENTAL": "true",
    "CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO": "off",
    "RUSTFLAGS": "-Clink-arg=-B/usr/bin/mold",
  },

  // A bunch of nice VS Code extensions for Rust development.
  "extensions": [
    "vadimcn.vscode-lldb",
    "matklad.rust-analyzer",
    "serayuzgur.crates",
    "tamasfe.even-better-toml",
    "yzhang.markdown-all-in-one",
    "eamodio.gitlens",
    "streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker",
    "nhoizey.gremlins",
  ],

  // To improve disk performance on Mac OS and Windows hosts, use a named
  // volume in place of the native `target` folder.
  //
  // See https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/improve-performance#_use-a-targeted-named-volume
  "mounts": [
    "source=my-project-dev-target,target=${containerWorkspaceFolder}/target,type=volume",
  ],

  // Set permissions on mounted target volume, and trivially invoke rustc to
  // install specific toolchain required by project's toolchain file (if any).
  "postCreateCommand": "sudo chown vscode target && rustc --version",

  "remoteUser": "vscode",

  // Give container ptrace capability so that lldb can be used for debugging.
  "runArgs": [ "--init", "--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE", "--security-opt", "seccomp=unconfined" ],

  "settings": {
    "lldb.executable": "/usr/bin/lldb",
    "files.watcherExclude": {
      "target/**": true,
    },
    "rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.command": "clippy",
  },
}
```
